# face_recoginition_using_python
 # Project Description  This project implements real-time face detection using OpenCV in Python. It utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier to detect frontal faces in a live video stream from the default camera. When a face is detected, a green rectangle is drawn around it. The program allows the user to exit by pressing the 'a' key.
